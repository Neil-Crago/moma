**MOMA** is a Rust framework for exploring number theory and cryptography through the lens of **Moving Origin Modular Arithmetic**.

The central idea is that the "zero point" or "origin" for modular arithmetic is not fixed. Instead, it shifts dynamically based on a contextual valueâ€”typically a prime number `p`. This provides a novel relational framework for analyzing the properties of integers.

The crate is designed for researchers and developers working in number theory, cryptography, and algorithmic data analysis.

## Core Concepts
The MOMA framework is built on a few simple but powerful concepts:

* MomaRing: The primary object for all calculations. A ring is defined by a modulus and a chosen OriginStrategy.

* OriginStrategy: A trait that defines how the origin moves. This makes the framework highly extensible. You can define custom logic for the origin's movement based on any property of the contextual prime.

* MassField: An analysis tool for mapping primes to the "composite mass" (sum of prime factors) found in the gap immediately following them.

* OriginDrift: A generic tool for measuring the volatility or "drift" of MOMA signatures for any given OriginStrategy over a sequence of primes.

## Features

* Flexible Core: A powerful and extensible system based on the MomaRing and OriginStrategy trait.

* Advanced Analysis Tools: Includes high-level structs like MassField and OriginDrift for statistical analysis.

* Cryptographic Primitives: Demonstrates how MOMA can be used to build cryptographic components like a Key Derivation Function.

* Prime Number Utilities: A helper primes module for primality testing and prime generation.

* Pure Rust: Built with safe, idiomatic Rust.

## Installation

Add MOMA to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
moma = "0.1.9"
```

-----

## Quick Start

The easiest way to get started is to create a `MomaRing` and calculate the "signature" of a prime. The signature is the MOMA residue of the sum of a prime and its predecessor.

```rust
use moma::core::MomaRing;
use moma::primes;
use moma::strategy;

fn main() {
    // 1. Create a MOMA ring with modulus 37.
    //    The origin will be the gap between a prime and its predecessor.
    let ring = MomaRing::new(37, strategy::PrimeGap);

    // 2. Let's analyze the prime p = 29.
    let p = 29;
    
    // The previous prime is 23.
    let p_prev = primes::prev_prime(p);
    
    // The origin for p=29 is the prime gap: 29 - 23 = 6.
    let origin = strategy::PrimeGap.calculate_origin(p);
    assert_eq!(origin, 6);

    // 3. Calculate the MOMA signature.
    //    The value to test is p + p_prev = 29 + 23 = 52.
    //    The residue is (52 + origin) % 37 = (52 + 6) % 37 = 21.
    let signature = ring.signature(p);

    println!("For p={}, the MOMA signature is: {}", p, signature);
    assert_eq!(signature, 21);
}
```

## Exploring Further

MOMA is more than just a simple calculator; it's a toolkit for exploration.

### Example 1: Prime Gap Analysis

You can use the `PrimeGapField` analyser to find statistical outliers in the sequence of primes.

```rust
// main.rs from the `moma-analysis` example
use moma::analysis::PrimeGapField;
use moma::primes;

// Generate primes up to 100
let primes: Vec<u64> = (1..=100).filter(|&n| primes::is_prime(n)).collect();

// Create a field to analyze gaps modulo 6
let field = PrimeGapField::new(&primes, 6);

// Find gaps that are significantly larger or smaller than their local average
let outliers = field.filter_by_bary_offset(3.0);

println!("Found {} outlier gaps:", outliers.len());
for gap in outliers {
    println!(
        "  Gap [{: >2}, {: >2}] of size {} deviates by {:.2}",
        gap.start_prime, gap.end_prime, gap.size, gap.bary_offset
    );
}
```

### Example 2: Cryptographic Key Derivation

MOMA can be used as a building block for cryptographic functions. The included `MomaKdf` example shows how to use it as a password-stretching function.

```rust
// main.rs from the `moma-kdf` example
// [Note: This requires the sha2 and hex crates]

// Create a KDF instance
let kdf = MomaKdf::new(
    "my-secret-password".as_bytes(),
    "random-public-salt".as_bytes(),
    1_000, // Iterations (work factor)
    32,    // Output key length in bytes
);

// Derive a strong 256-bit key
let key = kdf.derive_key();

println!("Derived AES-256 Key: {}", hex::encode(&key));
```

#### Example 3: Analyzing Composite Mass

Use MassField to analyze the distribution of composite matter between primes.

```rust
use moma::massfield::MassField;

// Create a field to analyze the range from 1 to 50.
let field = MassField::new(1, 50);
let mass_map = field.generate_mass_map();

// For p=13, p_next=17. Composites are 14, 15, 16.
// Mass = mass(14) + mass(15) + mass(16) = 2 + 2 + 4 = 8.
if let Some((prime, mass)) = mass_map.iter().find(|(p, _)| *p == 13) {
    println!("The composite mass after prime {} is {}", prime, mass);
    assert_eq!(*mass, 8);
}
```

#### Example : Measuring Strategy Volatility

Use OriginDrift to compare the stability of different OriginStrategy implementations.

```rust
use moma::origin_drift::OriginDrift;
use moma::strategy;
use moma::primes

// Create a drift analyzer for the PrimeGap strategy.
let mut drift_analyzer = OriginDrift::new(100, strategy::PrimeGap);

// Feed it a sequence of primes.
let mut p = 3;
for _ in 0..10 {
    drift_analyzer.next(p);
    p = primes::next_prime(p);
}

// A higher drift magnitude means the strategy is more volatile.
println!(
    "Drift magnitude for PrimeGap strategy: {:.2}",
    drift_analyzer.drift_magnitude()
);
```
