#### Example: MassField Analysis
This example demonstrates how to use the MassField struct from the moma crate.

It showcases how to instantiate the analyzer for a specific numerical range and generate a map of primes to the "composite mass" found in the gap that immediately follows each prime. The composite mass is the sum of the number of prime factors for all composite numbers in a given gap.

### Concepts Demonstrated
Creating a MassField for a specific range.

Generating the (prime, mass) map.

Analyzing the results to find the prime gap with the highest concentration of composite matter.
