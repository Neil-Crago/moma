# Example: MOMA for Cosmology Simulation

This example demonstrates a speculative and creative application of the MOMA framework to cosmology. It models a simplified "universe" where prime numbers represent fundamental events or epochs in time.

**This simulation is a conceptual counterpart to the `bioinformatics` example.** Both programs use the exact same MOMA tools (`ResonanceFinder`, `Entropy`) to explore the interplay between order and chaos, but they apply the concepts to different scientific domains. This highlights the abstract and versatile nature of the MOMA framework.

## Concepts Demonstrated

* **Structure Formation (Resonance)**: The simulation uses a `ResonanceFinder` to identify "special" primes. Resonance occurs when the MOMA signature of a prime aligns with another of its intrinsic properties. These events are treated as moments of **structure formation** in the simulated universe.

* **Chaotic Eras (Entropy Pulses)**: The simulation tracks the Shannon entropy of the most recent MOMA signatures. A sudden spike in entropy above a certain threshold is interpreted as a **"chaotic era"**â€”a disruptive event that could inhibit the formation of structure.

* **Abstract Modelling**: It showcases how the same abstract mathematical tools can be used to model complex, dynamic systems in vastly different fields, from biology to cosmology.

## Running the example
This will run the simulation, printing out each resonance event and any subsequent entropy pulses that are triggered, and will provide a final summary report.
